## WILDS WDL module for consensus variant calling.
## Combines results from multiple variant callers (HaplotypeCaller, Mutect2, mpileup)
## that have been annotated with Annovar to generate high-confidence consensus variant calls.
##
## Designed to be a modular component within the WILDS ecosystem that can be used
## independently or integrated with other WILDS workflows.
